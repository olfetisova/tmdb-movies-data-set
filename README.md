### Project Title
**Investigate a Dataset "TMDb Movie Data"** :movie_camera:

### Description
In this project I have used Jupyter notebook and created the Python code utilising Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. To investigate TMDb Movie Dataset:
1. I have brainstormed questions
* Which genres are most popular from year to year?
* What is the most popular movie of decade according to the vote?
2. I have wrangled and cleaned data
* investigating statistic information, data shape and data type
* dropping extraneous columns which aren't relevant to my questions and duplicated rows, filling missing values, splitting multiple values for separate rows
3. I have visualised my findings setting appropriate labels, scale, legends, and plot type
4. I made conclusions and defined limitations

### Files used
In my project I used the tmdb movies datasets file:
* tmdb-movies.csv
